# Dummy
# Active log Checker: 
The project gives a user interface that allows a user to view a list of hardcoded
users from a mock API server(Json Server). On clicking on any user, a modal will open which displays
the time ranges during which they were active on that day, with an option to view all the
periods of activity for different days using a calendar.
