# Dummy
# Active log Checker: 
The project gives a user interface that allows a user to view a list of hardcoded
users from a mock API server(Json Server). On clicking on any user, a modal will open which displays
the time ranges during which they were active on that day, with an option to view all the
periods of activity for different days using a calendar.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Node js
Visual Studio Code

#### Running the tests

Whenever you run the program you will get the list of users and on clicking on the particular user a modal will open with a modal header
as Activity log and by default first, it will display the start time and end time for that user for current day if any, else there is a Date picker from which user can select the previous date and check Activity Log. The JSON data is getting fetched from a mock API server.
